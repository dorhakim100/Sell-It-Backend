- **Frontend:** React Native

## Front End

Check out the Sell-It front-end built with React Native [here](https://github.com/dorhakim100/Sell-It-Front).

## Database Structure

The backend utilizes a modular approach with the following collections:

- **Item Collection:** Stores details of items listed for sale.
- **User Collection:** Contains user profiles and authentication data.
- **Chat Collection:** Manages conversation sessions between users.
- **Message Collection:** Holds individual messages exchanged in chats.

Data aggregation is implemented to ensure each collection only holds its own data and points to related extra data when needed.

## Routes & Middleware

Different API routes are safeguarded and customized through various middleware functions:

- **Authentication Middleware:** Verifies user tokens and session data.
- **Authorization Middleware:** Controls access based on user roles (e.g., admin, seller, buyer).
- **Validation Middleware:** Checks and sanitizes incoming data for consistency and security.
